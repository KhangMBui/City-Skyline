# Changing Color (Day and Night) City Skyline

This project is a simple and visually captivating representation of a city skyline that transitions between day and night, creating a dynamic and atmospheric effect. The project uses HTML and CSS to create a charming cityscape that changes colors and lighting as the day progresses.
